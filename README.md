# frcLogLens

A utility for large-scale analysis of standard data logs generated by robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition.

This is not optimized for single log file analysis, tools such as [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope) are extremely highly reccomended for that use case over this.

# WIP Project: Won't Even Compile At The Moment

Build: `python -m build`

Install Local: `python -m pip install .`

Lint: `ruff check .`

Format: `./format.sh`

Publish: `python -m twine upload dist/*`

Test Publish: `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*.tar.gz`

These commands attempt to upload any files in the `dist` directory, which should be periodically emptied.
