# frcLogLens

A utility for large-scale analysis of standard data logs generated by robots in the FIRST Robotics Competition.

This is not optimized for single log file analysis, tools such as [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope) are extremely highly reccomended for that use case over this.

# WIP Project: Won't Even Compile At The Moment

Build: `maturin build --release`

Install local: `python -m pip install .`

Lint py: `ruff check .`

Lint rust: `cargo clippy`

Format: `./format.sh`

Publish: `twine upload ./target/wheels/*`

Test publish: `twine upload --repository=testpypi ./target/wheels/*`

The project needs to be freshly built before publishing. Twine will try to publish all files in `./target/wheels`, including old builds, so running `rm -rf ./target/wheels` (or its Windows equivalent) is suggested.
